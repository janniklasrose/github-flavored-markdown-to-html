<p>Convert Markdown to html via python or with a command line interface. Uses <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/">Githubs online
Markdown-to-html-API</a> as well as
<a href="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/gist-embed-52b3348036dbd45f4ab76e44de42ebc4.css" rel="nofollow">Githubs Markdown-CSS</a>.
Requires internet connection to work.</p>
<p>This module is intended to be used for the creation of
static pages from markdown files, for example in conjunction with a static website builder
or github actions if you host on Github, but can be very well used for any other purpose.
It also allows you to convert the html files to pdf on the fly.</p>
<p>Advantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets you specify the markdown to convert as a string, as a repository path, as a local
file name or as a hyperlink.</li>
<li>Pulls any images referenced in the markdown files from the web/ your local storage and
places them in a directory relative to your website root, so you can host it all locally
without relying on third-party-websites.</li>
<li>Creates all links as root-relative hyperlinks and lets you specify the root directory
as well as the locations for css and images, but uses smart standard values for
everything.</li>
<li>Supports inline LaTeX-formulas (use <code>$</code>-formula-<code>$</code> to use them), which GitHub usually
doesn't (this is done using the <a href="https://latex.codecogs.com/" rel="nofollow">Codecogs EqnEditor</a>).</li>
<li>Supports exporting as pdf with or without Github styling, using the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/" rel="nofollow">pdfkit</a> python module (if it is installed).</li>
<li>Tested and optimized to look good when using
<a href="https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader">Darkreader</a> (the
.js-module, not nessesarily the browser extension. This means that formulas are displayed
with a light text when in darkmode, amongst other things).</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>
<p>Use
<code>pip3 install gh_md_to_html</code> (might require <code>sudo</code> on Linux) and optionally
<code>pip3 install pdfkit</code> (if you want to use the optional pdf features) to install it.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>
<p>If you want to access the interface with your command line, you can just supply
<code>gh_markdown_to_html</code> with the arguments documented in th help text (accessible with
<code>gh_markdown_to_html -h</code> and shown below.)</p>
<p>If you want to access the interface via python, you can use</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python"><pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">gh_md_to_html</span></pre></div>
<p>and then use <code>gh_md_to_html.main()</code> with the same arguments (and default values) you would
supply to the command line interface.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-documentation" class="anchor" href="#documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation</h3>
<p>All arguments and how they work are documented in the help text of the program, which looks
like this:</p>
<pre><code>usage: __init__.py [-h] [-t {file,repo,web,string}] [-w WEBSITE_ROOT]
                   [-d DESTINATION] [-i IMAGE_PATHS] [-c CSS_PATHS]
                   [-n OUTPUT_NAME] [-p OUTPUT_PDF] [-s STYLE_PDF] [-f FOOTER]
                   [-m MATH]
                   MD-origin

Convert markdown to HTML using the GitHub API and some additional tweaks with
python.

positional arguments:
  MD-origin             Where to find the markdown file that should be
                        converted to html

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t {file,repo,web,string}, --origin-type {file,repo,web,string}
                        In what way the MD-origin-argument describes the origin
                        of the markdown file to use. Defaults to file. The
                        options mean: 
                        * file: takes a relative or absolute path to a file
                        * repo: takes a path to a markdown-file in a repository,
                        such as &lt;user_name&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;/&lt;path_to_markdown&gt;.md
                        * web: takes an url to a markdown file
                        * string: takes a string containing the files content
  -w WEBSITE_ROOT, --website-root WEBSITE_ROOT
                        Only relevant if you are creating the html for a static
                        website which you manage using git or something similar.
                        --html-root is the directory from which you serve your
                        website (which is needed to correctly generate the links
                        within the generated html, such as the link pointing to
                        the css, since they are all root- relative), and can be
                        a relative as well as an absolute path. Defaults to the
                        directory you called this script from. If you intent to
                        view the html file on your laptop instead of hosting it
                        on a static site, website-root should be a dot and
                        destination not set. The reason the generated html files
                        use root-relative links to embed images is that on many
                        static websites, https://foo/bar/index.html can be
                        accessed via https://foo/bar, in which case relative
                        (non-root- relative) links in index.html will be
                        interpreted as relative to foo instead of bar, which can
                        cause images not to load.
  -d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION
                        Where to store the generated html. This path is relative
                        to --website-root. Defaults to "".
  -i IMAGE_PATHS, --image-paths IMAGE_PATHS
                        Where to store the images needed or generated for the
                        html. This path is relative to website-root. Defaults to
                        the "images"-folder within the destination folder.
  -c CSS_PATHS, --css-paths CSS_PATHS
                        Where to store the css needed for the html (as a path
                        relative to the website root). Defaults to the
                        "&lt;WEBSITE_ROOT&gt;/github-markdown-css"-folder.
  -n OUTPUT_NAME, --output-name OUTPUT_NAME
                        What the generated html file should be called like. Use
                        &lt;name&gt; within the value to refer to the name of the
                        markdown file that is being converted (if you don't use
                        "-t string").
  -p OUTPUT_PDF, --output-pdf OUTPUT_PDF
                        If set, the file will also be saved as a pdf file in the
                        same directory as the html file, using pdfkit, a python
                        library which will also need to be installed for this to
                        work. You may use the &lt;name&gt; variable in this value like
                        you did in --output-name.
  -s STYLE_PDF, --style-pdf STYLE_PDF
                        If set to false, the generated pdf (only relevant if you
                        use --output-pdf) will not be styled using github's css.
  -f FOOTER, --footer FOOTER
                        An optional piece of html which will be included as a
                        footer where the 'hosted with &lt;3 by github'-footer
                        usually is. Defaults to None, meaning that the section
                        usually containing said footer will be omitted
                        altogether.
  -m MATH, --math MATH  If set to True, which is the default, LaTeX-formulas
                        using $formula$-notation will be rendered.
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned above, any image referenced in the markdown file is stored locally and
referenced using a root-relative hyperlinks in the generated html. How the converter
guesses the location of the image is shown in the following table, with the type of imagelink noted on the top and the type of input markdown noted on the left:</p>
