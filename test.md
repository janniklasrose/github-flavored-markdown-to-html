If anyone could solve this question
Your customer needs an automated system to patrol the highways. The job of the system is to
collect the following information on vehicles traveling down a certain stretch of highway: license
plate number, current speed, and speed limit. A program is required to determine if a speeding
ticket is needed for each set of data. Ticket will only be issued when number of miles per hours
(mph) over the speed limit is at least 5 mph. Ticket prices are calculated as follow: base + fee *
<number of mph over the speed limit>. The base is always $150 and the fee per mph over the
speed limit is varied according to number of mph over the speed limit. The fee per mph over the
speed limit is $5 when number of mph over the speed limit is no more than 20 mph. However,
the fee per mph over the speed limit is $10 when number of mph over the speed limit is between
20 mph and 50 mph. In addition, a ticket of $1000 is automatically given to vehicle when
number of mph over the speed limit is more than 50 mph.

You can assume that valid data will be provided, and your program must allow the processing to
be repeated until a sentinel value of “QUIT” is entered. It must display percent of ticketed
vehicles and average ticket amount. Follow the user-interface as shown below including 2 digits
after the decimal point. You must run the following test cases as one run.
